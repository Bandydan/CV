# Daniil Marynich CV

### SUMMARY
I was born in 1983.
I was a skilled web developer with more then eight years in web-development (PHP, Python, PERL, MySQL, JS).

From the year 2012 I'm turning my career goals to management path: worked as PM in remote foreign company with a very small team for more then 4 years, worked as PM in a small company with russian origins.

I've been CTO and co-owner of IT learning courses since March 2016.
Now I am interested in project management position for a long term. I want to work with foreign customers, build successfull teams and gain more and more experience in that field.

My advanteages are:

- wide and interesting experience in the field.
- good speaking and writing english, which always can be imporved though.
- perfect communication skills, I consider myself as a problem solver.
- strong tension to sistematization in all the fields I'm involved in. As an example, I have collection of business books in some fields, and that is 570 books, meticulously renamed with a special pattern.
- smart laziness. I prefer to do task once and for good then to make a lot of approaches with small movements and a lot of chit-chat.
- strong patience and explanation skills. I teach since 2015.
